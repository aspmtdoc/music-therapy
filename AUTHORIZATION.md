# Authorizing Users

When the site is brought, it is created with a super user.  The super user can log into the admin panel at [/admin](/admin).  From here, a new user of the site can be added.  Note here that by user, we mean someone who will be updating the forms of a patient.  Users can be from the Authentication and Authorization section, using the add users button.  Once a user is added, their credentials can be used to get access to the site.  Authorization is required to access all section of the site.
